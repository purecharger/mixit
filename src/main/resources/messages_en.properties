ticketing.description.why=Why do you need to pre-register ?February
ticketing.description.intro=We know that it has become difficult to acquire the precious pass that opens the gates of this conference. Each year you are more and more who want to come, but the ticket number is limited. But this year (as last year), no need for you to be stressed out, we are opening a pre-register step for everybody for <b>3 full weeks (until March, 3rd, midnight)</b>. This year we are in a new place an we will have more available tickets. Take 5 minutes when you can, enter your firstname, lastname and email 
ticketing.description.how=Then, we are going to do what every conference overwhelmed by its own popularity does (Google IO, Apple WWDC, NgConf, and... MiXiT): we are going to distribute the tickets among those who pre-registered with a random(). The lucky ones (most of you) will receive a link to buy their ticket. The less lucky ones will be able to catch up with the talks videos less than a week after the conference.
ticketing.description.hack=I already see some of you thinking about registering several times with all their hotmail and yahoo addresses, but we will take a close look, and <b>the ones who get caught will be excluded from the process.</b> If you want to check your subscription, you can log in on our website with the same email adress used for pre-registering step. You can see on your profile page the state of your pre-registration.
ticketing.description.plus=One last thing: to ensure fairness among everybody, if you don’t want to use your link to buy a ticket, we will give it to someone else. We won’t authorize a transfer: the buyer of the ticket must have the same email used for the pre-registering step.

speaker.welcome=Welcome to MiXiT 2019
speaker.session=Your session
speaker.session.description=The whole planning is available on the page <a href="/schedule">schedule</a>. You can update your abstract online when you are login on the website. If you prefer that we update your abstract for you send your modifications by email to <a href="mailto:contact@mix-it.fr">contact@mix-it.fr</a>
speaker.event=Your session
speaker.event.description1=We (the organizers) will be in venue (a french school named CPE), where the event takes place, on Wednesday 18th afternoon until 6:00 pm (the day prior the conference). If you want to have a look at the rooms and the venue, feel free to join us.
speaker.event.description2=The organisation team will be helped by a few volunteer students and they will probably not recognize you even though you are the conference stars. As they will handle the check-in, you will need to <b>give them your name</b> and tell them you are a speaker to get your badge. <b>You do not need a printed ticket</b>.
speaker.event.description3=The conference will start at 8:45am with a few words from us. Then <b>each speaker will have 30 seconds (timeboxed) to introduce her/his talk/workshop</b> (Speaker name, session name, room and schedule, key ideas) in English or French (there's no introduction for random talks to keep the surprise). The first keynote will then start around 8:55 am.
speaker.event.description4=The conference take place at CPE Lyon - Domaine Scientifique de la Doua - 69100 Villeurbanne
speaker.event.description5=To have more informations on how to come, you can have all the informations on <a href="/come">this page</a>
speaker.event.description6=For lunch we will serve local meals made from local, almost organic, products according to the slow food vision, made with love by the awesome communauté du goût. This meal will be served around noon.
speaker.event.description7=A vegetarian meal is planned. If you have any food allergies, we're sorry we can't assure you about your specific allergens at the moment. But do not hesitate to ask us what are your options between the proposed food.
speaker.hotel=Your hotel
speaker.hotel.description1=For those who asked for a hotel room, these requests are being processed. The hotels we use to book for our speakers are located on the metro A, station Hotel de Ville - Louis Pradel. If you want to move to your hotel you can watch the <a href="http://plan-interactif.tcl.fr/">website</a> of the local transportation company (TCL).
speaker.hotel.description2=You are dispatched in 3 hotels
speaker.diner=Speakers dinner
speaker.diner.description=We booked the speakers dinner the night before the conference (18th of April, 8:00 pm). The restaurant, <a href="http://www.bouchon-colette.com/">Bouchon Colette</a>, is located at 62 rue Mercière, 69002 Lyon. (Metro A, Cordeliers). We will meet at the hotel or the venue to move together to this restaurant. You can also go by yourself.
speaker.party=Mid-conference party
speaker.party.description1=A mid-conference (19th evening) cocktail is planned in the Lyon City Hall, located 1 place de la Comédie (Metro A, Hotel-de-Ville Louis Pradel). It's on invitation only (no unknown people, because of security concerns). If you didn't tell us in the form that you have a travelling companion, please send us an email.
speaker.party.description2=
speaker.slide=Your slides
speaker.slide.description1=There is no template for the slides. But if you want to include the MiXiT logo you can
speaker.slide.description2=It could be difficult to see the bottom of the slides from the back of some conference rooms. Consequently, we recommend to use a big font and to place the text to the top half of your slides.
speaker.slide.description3=Please do not have more than one slide to introduce your company.
speaker.slide.description4=If your talk is in English, please make sure to speak slowly for the French audience :). Talks are 50 mn long, questions included, we will warn you 5 minutes before the session ends. Workshops are 1 hour 50 mn long, in smaller rooms. If the attendees need to bring their computers with specific software or prepare in some way (download, ...), please say so on your talk abstract and warn us.
